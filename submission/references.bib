	abstract = {This study examines the longstanding need and challenge of providing contextual analysis of historical images stored in digital visual archives and the accessibility of retrieving contextual information from these historical archives. Contextual analysis is essential for disciplines such as history and art history, as it allows for the contextualization of artwork and historical sources with historical narratives, which, in turn, enhances understanding of the artistic or political expression in the contents of cultural products. To address this challenge, a novel approach is proposed utilizing computer vision to trace the circulation and dissemination of historical photographs in their original contexts. This method involves first using YOLO v7 to crop historical images from pictorial magazines, then training machine learning models on the cropped printed images plus another large dataset of original historical photographs, and comparing the similarity of images between the datasets of printed images and original photographs. To ensure accuracy of image similarities between the two subsets with distinct image qualities, an ensemble of three machine learning models—Vision Transformer, EfficientNetv2, and Swin Transformer—was developed. Through this system, contexts in the circulation of historical photographs were discovered and new insights regarding the editing strategies of propaganda magazines in East Asia during WWII were uncovered. These outcomes offer supporting evidence for previous research in the history and art historical disciplines, and demonstrate the potential of computer vision for uncovering new information from digital visual archives. Our model achieves a 77.8\% top-15 retrieval accuracy on our evaluation dataset.},

	abstract = {Innovative technologies are improving the accessibility, preservation, and searchability of born-digital and digitised records. In particular, Artificial Intelligence is opening new opportunities for archivists and researchers. However, the experience of scholars (particularly humanities scholars) and other users remain understudied. This article asks 
              how 
              and 
              why 
              researchers and general users are, or are not, using computational methods. This research is informed by an open-call survey, completed by 22 individuals, and semi-structured interviews with 33 professionals, including archivists, librarians, digital humanists, literary scholars, historians, and computer scientists. Drawing on these results, this article offers an analysis of user experiences of computational research methods applied to digitised and born-digital archives. With a focus on humanities and social science researchers, this article also discusses users who resist this kind of research, perhaps because they lack the skills necessary to engage with these materials at scale, or because they prefer to use more traditional methods, such as close reading and historical analysis. Here, we explore the uses of computational and more “traditional” research methodologies applied to digital records. We also make a series of recommendations to elevate users’ computational skills but also to improve the digital infrastructure to make archives more accessible and usable.},

	abstract = {We reflect on some of the preliminary findings of the Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) research project around annotations of photographic archives from the Swiss Society for Folklore Studies (SSFS) as knowledge practices, the underlying technological decisions, and their impact. The aim is not only to seek more information but to find new approaches of understanding the way in which people’s memory relate to the collective, public form of archival memory and ultimately how users figure in and shape the digital archive. We provide a proof-of-concept workflow based on automatically generated annotations comprising 53,481 photos that were subjected to object detection using Faster R-CNN Inception ResNet V2. Of the detected objects, 184,609 have a detection score greater than 0.5, 123,529 have a score greater than 0.75, and 88,442 have a score greater than 0.9. A threshold of 0.75 was set for the dissemination of our annotations, compatible with the W3C Web Annotation Data Model (WADM) and embedded in our IIIF Manifests. In the near future, the workflow will be upgraded to allow for the co-existence of various, and occasionally conflicting, assertions made by both human and machine users. We believe that Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) standards should be used to improve the sustainability of such an ecosystem and to foster collaboration between actors in cultural heritage.},
